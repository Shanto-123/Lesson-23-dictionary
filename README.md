# Lesson-23-dictionary
The code defines a dictionary `user` containing information like name, age, email, and verification status. A new key-value pair `"Job": "Teaching"` is added to the dictionary, and the updated dictionary is printed. The `print(user.get("Is_verified"))` statement retrieves and prints the value of the `"Is_verified"` key, which is `True`.
